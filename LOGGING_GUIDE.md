# 🎯 Console Logging Improvements - Summary

## What Was Changed

I've added **comprehensive console logging** throughout the PDF editor to help you debug PDF loading and processing issues. This makes it much easier to see exactly what's happening when you upload and work with PDFs.

---

## 📊 Logging Added To

### 1. **PdfViewer.tsx** 🎬
- PDF.js worker setup with version info
- Detailed error messages when PDFs fail to load
- Page navigation logging (which page, total pages)
- Zoom level changes
- Page rotation
- Error stack traces for debugging

### 2. **FileUpload.tsx** 📤
- File selection details (name, size, type, date)
- Blob URL creation confirmation
- File drag-and-drop events
- File validation warnings

### 3. **PDFEditor.tsx** 🎨
- File selection confirmation
- PDF save process steps (buffer size, blob size)
- Download confirmation with filename
- Save error details

## 🔍 How to Use the Logs

### **1. Open Browser Console**
- Press **F12** or **Ctrl+Shift+J** (Windows/Linux)
- On Mac: **Cmd+Option+J** or **F12**

### **2. Upload a PDF**
You should see logs like:
```
🔧 PDF.js Worker Setup:
   Version: 5.4.296
   Source: https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/...

📤 File selected:
  name: "document.pdf"
  size: "2.45 MB"
  type: "application/pdf"

🔗 Object URL created: blob:http://localhost:5173/...

✅ PDF loaded successfully: 15 pages
```

### **3. Watch for Issues**
If you see ❌ or ⚠️ messages, the logs will show:
- Exact error message
- Error name and stack trace
- What was being processed

## 🔧 Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### **"Failed to fetch dynamically imported module"**

This is the PDF.js worker error. Two quick fixes:

**Option 1: Use Local Worker File** (Recommended)
```bash
# Copy worker from node_modules
mkdir -p public
cp node_modules/pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.js public/

# Then restart dev server
npm run dev
```

**Option 2: Check Internet**
- Make sure your internet is working
- The app tries 3 different CDNs as fallbacks
- If all fail, use Option 1

### **"Error loading PDF" on Canvas**

Check console for the specific error. Usually means:
- The PDF file is corrupted
- File isn't actually a PDF (wrong extension)
- PDF is password-protected
