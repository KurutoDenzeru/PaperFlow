## 🎯 The Problem You Had

```
Error: Setting up fake worker failed: 
"Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: ...pdf.worker.min.js"
```

**Why:** The app tried to load a helper file (PDF.js worker) from the internet, but it failed.

---

## ✨ The Solution

### **3-Step Fix**

```bash
# 1. Copy worker file from node_modules to public folder
mkdir -p public
cp node_modules/pdfjs-dist/build/pdf.worker.min.js public/

# 2. Restart the development server
npm run dev

# 3. Clear browser cache
# Windows/Linux: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
# Mac: Cmd+Shift+Delete
```

## 📊 Console Logging Examples

### **On Page Load**
```
🔧 PDF.js Worker Setup:
   Version: 5.4.296

   Fallbacks: https://unpkg.com/... | ...
```

### **When You Upload a File**
```
📤 File selected:
  name: "document.pdf"
  size: "2.45 MB"
  type: "application/pdf"
  lastModified: "10/27/2025, 2:30:45 PM"

🔗 Object URL created: blob:http://localhost:5173/8f3c4e2a-1b5f...

✅ File selected in PDFEditor:
  file: "document.pdf"
  size: "2.45 MB"
  url: "blob:..."
```

### **When PDF Loads Successfully**
```
✅ PDF loaded successfully: 15 pages
```

### **When You Navigate or Interact**
```
📄 Page changed: 3/15
🔍 Zoomed in: 100% → 120%

```

### **If Something Goes Wrong**
```
❌ PDF Loading Error: {
  message: "Failed to fetch",
  name: "Error",

## 🎨 UI Improvements

When a PDF fails to load, users now see:
- **Red error box** at top-right
- **Clear error message** explaining what failed
- **Helpful hint**: "Check browser console (F12) for more details"
- Error details available in both UI and console

---

## 🚀 How to Verify It's Working

1. **Open Browser Console** → Press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+J`
2. **Upload a PDF** → Watch the console
3. **Check for Success Messages**:
   - ✅ Worker setup message
   - ✅ File selected message
   - ✅ PDF loaded message

If you see these → **Everything works!** ✨
